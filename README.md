## Introduction

> Your client for this week's challenge is Gokada - the largest last mile delivery service in Nigeria. Gokada works is partnered with motorbike owners and drivers to deliver parcels across Lagos, Nigeria. Gokada has completed more than a million deliveries in less than a year, with a fleet of over 1200 riders.
One key issue Gokada has faced as it expands its service is the sub-optimal placement of pilots (Gokada calls their motor drivers pilots) and clients who want to use Gokada to send their parcel. This has led to a high number of unfulfilled delivery requests. 


## Objective
>Gokada is asking 10 Academy trainees, to work on its data to help it understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend drivers locations that increase the fraction of complete orders. Since drivers are paid based on the number of requests they accept, your solution will help Gokada business grow both in terms of client satisfaction and increased business.

## Data

> The data used for generating these back testing results comes from several historical data of stocks and crypto currency trades.
> These datasets are publicly available and can be found at [yahoo finance](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN2311.html) and [binance](https://www.binance.com/en/landing/data).
> You can read a brief description of what a K-line or candlestick data is [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/candlestick.asp).

> Basic features of the data sets:
>
> - Date: The day the specific trade was recorded
> - Open: The opening price of the trade at the beginning of the specific day
> - High: The highest price of the trade for the specific day
> - Low: The lowest price of the trade for the specific day
> - Close: The closing price of the trade at the end of the specific day
> - Adj Close: The closing price after adjustments for all applicable splits and dividend distributions
> - Volume: The volume of the trade for the specific day

## Requirements

> Pip

> FastApi

> Zookeeper

> kafka-python

> Apache kafka

> backtrader and yfinance

> React (nodejs)

> Apache airflow

> Python 3.5 or above

> Docker and Docker compose

You can find the full list of requirements in the requirements.txt file

## Install

> We highly recommend you create a new virtual environment and install every required modules and libraries on the virtual environment.

### Installing this application

- First clone this repo to your local machine using the command below

```
git clone https://github.com/TenAcademy/backtesting.git
cd backtesting
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples

> ### Using this application locally

- One can start using the application by first running the front and back ends.
- You can run the front-end by running the following command on the terminal
- A more detailed instruction regarding the front-end can be found at presentation/readme.md file.

```
cd presentation
npm run start
```

- You can run the back-end by running the following command on the terminal

```
cd api
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

> ### Interacting with the front end

- After running the front end, one can simply go over to the browser and type in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). or click this [link](http://localhost:3000)
- A page similar to this will appear.
